Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:02.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, Now we can go
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.41,0:00:10.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Welcome~\n\nIt's very nice and a little bit scary to see you all again
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.75,0:00:19.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And especially happy to see a lot of old friends and also a lot of people that are new here
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.19,0:00:27.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Anyway, I'm going to talk about how to write code
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.23,0:00:39.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and in particular \n-- a question has been boggle for a while, and I know it has boggle for a lot of new people -- is \n "What is good modern C++" ?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.45,0:00:46.18,Default,,0,0,0,,We've done lots to the the languages over the last five years
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.37,0:00:52.47,Default,,0,0,0,,And lot of people have ideas about what it is to write good c++
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.74,0:00:55.74,Default,,0,0,0,,and , lots of people ask about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.74,0:01:04.02,Default,,0,0,0,,so, this spring, I started a project trying to make some guidelines to how to write this
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.05,0:01:09.46,Default,,0,0,0,,turned out that other people were on the same kind of idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.61,0:01:13.79,Default,,0,0,0,,so some of us try to provide some useful answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.04,0:01:22.28,Default,,0,0,0,,and one of the things that is important here, is that we would like to help many people
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.61,0:01:27.32,Default,,0,0,0,,thers is more that 4million c++ programers.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.57,0:01:34.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and if we come up with a solution that can (only) be handled by 200 language experts, we failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.47,0:01:42.20,Default,,0,0,0,,so , this is an attempt to be able to help a lot of people.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.57,0:01:46.56,Default,,0,0,0,,and a lot of we've seen it, we have a great language now.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.65,0:01:52.74,Default,,0,0,0,,it's a modern language, it can do really nice things that we couldn't do 10-20 years ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.79,0:01:59.63,Default,,0,0,0,,c++11 is good. c++14 is better. both are in wide-spread production use.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.63,0:02:02.09,Default,,0,0,0,,These are not toy languages.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.24,0:02:08.61,Default,,0,0,0,,And from I see in the standards commitee, c++17 is even better.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.85,0:02:22.51,Default,,0,0,0,,There is technical specifications like filesystem and concepts and such that are rolling out. Things are happening.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.51,0:02:44.95,Default,,0,0,0,,So, I know from experience, from wide experience from industrial experience, that c++1* is easier to write, easier to maintain, runs faster and can express more that older c++ styles with less code
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.54,0:02:47.11,Default,,0,0,0,,This is a fact
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.52,0:02:51.40,Default,,0,0,0,,It's also a fact that very few people do it!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.67,0:02:57.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe you know a thousand people that write such modern code.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.74,0:03:02.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe you know 10 thousand people, but that's only very tiny small fraction of the community.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.86,0:03:04.35,Default,,0,0,0,,We have to do something better.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.35,0:03:10.78,Default,,0,0,0,,People are writting c++ in really archaic and foreign styles
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.23,0:03:16.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Also you going to web and you'll see every little so-and-so trying to be language expert.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.20,0:03:20.40,Default,,0,0,0,,And discussing the sanitates of rvalue references.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.40,0:03:27.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Which does actually matter in most code unless you are writting a high performence library for use of others.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.65,0:03:34.68,Default,,0,0,0,,So, they are all trying to be language lawyers and getting lost in technical details.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.11,0:03:43.55,Default,,0,0,0,,so basicly idea is "Doctor, docker, it hurts when I hit myself on the head with a hammer". The obvious answer is "so don't do it!"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.81,0:03:45.81,Default,,0,0,0,,And that's what we are trying to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.93,0:03:49.05,Default,,0,0,0,,There is a quote by me --
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.45,0:03:56.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Within c++ language there is a smaller simplier safer language struggling to get out.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.77,0:04:02.50,Default,,0,0,0,,I think I said that in 94, 92... It a long time ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.75,0:04:05.78,Default,,0,0,0,,it is even more true today that was there.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.93,0:04:12.63,Default,,0,0,0,,You can simplify the code\n you can maintain the efficiency\nand we don't limit what you can say.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.63,0:04:14.24,Default,,0,0,0,,these are important things.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.24,0:04:16.24,Default,,0,0,0,,This is C++!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.24,0:04:21.11,Default,,0,0,0,,It's not a so specialize language for a paticular application.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.73,0:04:25.34,Default,,0,0,0,,So, lets get it out! lets get it out now!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.57,0:04:30.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Lot of people solution to getting things better and simpler it to invent new languages.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.84,0:04:32.84,Default,,0,0,0,,but that not now.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.84,0:04:42.18,Default,,0,0,0,,If you invent a really good new language now,  large number of people will be able to use it, in 10 years, if you succeed.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.36,0:04:48.97,Default,,0,0,0,,The succee rate for new languages especially general purpose programming languages is very close to zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.97,0:04:50.97,Default,,0,0,0,,so, lets do it now!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.20,0:04:53.91,Default,,0,0,0,,And I want to use those compilers.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.91,0:04:59.92,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, have you seen what compilers can do with your code interms of optimizing it?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.92,0:05:08.69,Default,,0,0,0,,doesn't matter which compiler you are using for a modern compiler and sort of standard hardware. it's amazing.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.90,0:05:15.69,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, I am not sure what I could have done it if I had 10 years. but they did. this is going on for a long time.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.69,0:05:23.70,Default,,0,0,0,,this doesn't just happen for a new language unless you can hijack the c++ code generation phase. which is a fair gain.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.94,0:05:32.82,Default,,0,0,0,,So, I'm going to look for coding guidelines, provide guidence to people who wants to write modern c++ what ever that means.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.01,0:05:40.04,Default,,0,0,0,,And, I know that just telling people what to do doesn't quite work.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.04,0:05:43.04,Default,,0,0,0,,so you need support by tools and libraries.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.18,0:05:50.25,Default,,0,0,0,,and again, we want generality, we want performence, we want simple code, and we want portibility.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.25,0:05:54.77,Default,,0,0,0,,I dont want to be tight down by paticular hardware, paticular operation system.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.05,0:05:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,those all the gameness.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.52,0:06:02.78,Default,,0,0,0,,I think we can do it. And I think we can do it, I know that I can't do it alone.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.78,0:06:06.50,Default,,0,0,0,,I know that well that might be a genius somewhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.50,0:06:08.99,Default,,0,0,0,,But I think I know that no individual can do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.14,0:06:11.97,Default,,0,0,0,,And, no single company can
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.11,0:06:17.39,Default,,0,0,0,,It will be cature
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.39,0:06:19.15,Default,,0,0,0,,and you couldn't trust it all time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.15,0:06:27.14,Default,,0,0,0,,people explained that to me a long time ago to ensure that I took part in the (c++) standardization, so please help.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.14,0:06:33.16,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm going to say a little bit about what help we would like and who we are and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.16,0:06:36.05,Default,,0,0,0,,so the initial work started
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.05,0:06:39.39,Default,,0,0,0,,there was a project out of microsoft by Herb Sutter and friends
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.39,0:06:42.01,Default,,0,0,0,,I started something at Morgan Stanley
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.01,0:06:45.98,Default,,0,0,0,,CERN has joined and contributed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.98,0:06:47.98,Default,,0,0,0,,And things are available.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.98,0:06:49.98,Default,,0,0,0,,its there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.98,0:06:55.06,Default,,0,0,0,,you can find it on github, give you the urls towards the end.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.06,0:06:58.29,Default,,0,0,0,,there is guide lines. a lot of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.49,0:07:00.64,Default,,0,0,0,,there is little support library.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.64,0:07:11.48,Default,,0,0,0,,which is some very simple classes that mostly mapping into standard library stuff if not  map straghtly into portable c++.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.48,0:07:16.44,Default,,0,0,0,,portable meaning microsoft, gcc, clang; Windows, Linux, Mac
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.53,0:07:17.64,Default,,0,0,0,,and mac yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.97,0:07:25.52,Default,,0,0,0,,there is analyze tool that will be ship by the guy at microsoft that wrote it next month
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.53,0:07:38.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and we hope to have port available later. maybe November? I don't know. I mean, you know, software project some time suffer delays.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.42,0:07:41.09,Default,,0,0,0,,but we are planning for it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.13,0:07:46.58,Default,,0,0,0,,it exists. so I am saying anything in this talk that are science fictions.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.93,0:07:50.52,Default,,0,0,0,,and its MIT licensed, so its open and free.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.52,0:07:51.44,Default,,0,0,0,,so you can get it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.88,0:07:54.10,Default,,0,0,0,,and there's more talk about this.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.02,0:08:01.92,Default,,0,0,0,,I am going to explain what we are trying to do with higher level terms with some examples
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.17,0:08:04.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Herb Sutter is going to talk more about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.23,0:08:13.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Gabriel Dos Reis are going to talk how, er, ties into some of the work been done in the standard commitee for writting better code.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.32,0:08:21.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Neil Macintosh who wrote the tool that we work with, are going to talk about static analysis and some of the classes.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.95,0:08:23.12,Default,,0,0,0,,This is all this weak.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.83,0:08:29.08,Default,,0,0,0,,This is a problem with coding rules, with guide lines.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.33,0:08:30.44,Default,,0,0,0,,which is...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.45,0:08:32.65,Default,,0,0,0,,have you even seen one you really liked?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.92,0:08:37.18,Default,,0,0,0,,that might be necessary. but it's like medicine, doesn't taste good.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.77,0:08:39.63,Default,,0,0,0,,we all hate coding rules.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.79,0:08:44.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Usual caveats and thanks to the people who was made the less usual and paticular cases.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.92,0:08:46.31,Default,,0,0,0,,but basicly we don't like it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.60,0:08:48.76,Default,,0,0,0,,and one of the reasons is that
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.97,0:08:53.48,Default,,0,0,0,,coding guidelines tend to be written to prevent accident
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.77,0:08:59.96,Default,,0,0,0,,so to keep novices that are not as smart as us from doing stupid things
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.01,0:09:02.87,Default,,0,0,0,,so it's long lists of don't do this and don't do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.96,0:09:03.49,Default,,0,0,0,,and
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.68,0:09:07.03,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't like such lists and I know most of you don't like neither.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.18,0:09:12.34,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's very often written at the start of an organization
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.40,0:09:18.41,Default,,0,0,0,,when people is little bit uncertain about what they want to do and they want to avoid problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.41,0:09:21.54,Default,,0,0,0,,and rules tend to focus on low-level things
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.54,0:09:22.99,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, eh
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.07,0:09:25.20,Default,,0,0,0,,do use camel case underscores
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.20,0:09:27.90,Default,,0,0,0,,how many yea spaces to use to indent
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.24,0:09:32.08,Default,,0,0,0,,these are all very interesting, could be in the essential for our organization 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.15,0:09:37.34,Default,,0,0,0,,but it has nothing much to do with how you get quality software at the higher level.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.41,0:09:41.36,Default,,0,0,0,,how do you actually recognize a good piece of code when you came to see it?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.76,0:09:46.23,Default,,0,0,0,,a lot of them simply sets restrictions.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.44,0:09:55.96,Default,,0,0,0,,don't use overloading; don't use exceptions; don't use multiple-inheritance; don't use casts.... all kinds of rules like that
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.11,0:10:04.36,Default,,0,0,0,,some are good. some are bad. some are good in some paticular environment. some are not.\nAnd really, there is lot of bad advice out there.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.61,0:10:09.77,Default,,0,0,0,,there are guidelines that tell you that you really should trying write java.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.84,0:10:12.90,Default,,0,0,0,,when if you want to write java and you how to do which?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.90,0:10:18.36,Default,,0,0,0,,don't try to stop c++ programmer from writting good c++.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.36,0:10:22.91,Default,,0,0,0,,And "C with classes"? It was really cool in 1986
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.04,0:10:25.84,Default,,0,0,0,,that a long time ago. a lot of you weren't born then.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.84,0:10:36.41,Default,,0,0,0,,and there are people think that really the world came to an end in 1978 when K&R came out.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.41,0:10:42.09,Default,,0,0,0,,and they might accept a few things they got from c++ like function prototype and const
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.09,0:10:46.50,Default,,0,0,0,,but basically you really should write code as if we do it in C.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.80,0:10:50.35,Default,,0,0,0,,really dumb idea in my opinion, but we'll get to that.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.35,0:10:53.87,Default,,0,0,0,,also, coding rules get outdated.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.87,0:11:08.32,Default,,0,0,0,,I saw a recent year recommendation to use a  coding guideline , a really good guidelines, it describe how to write good code in about 198s. it hasn't been updated, that's a long time ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.45,0:11:10.78,Default,,0,0,0,,and so they became a drag.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.78,0:11:23.66,Default,,0,0,0,,a lot of code are specialized for particular application areas like I helped to write a set of guidelines for hard-realtime softwares or flight controlls 
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.02,0:11:27.25,Default,,0,0,0,,these are very nice guidelines for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.25,0:11:30.21,Default,,0,0,0,,but then people try use it in some other areas.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:30.21,0:11:38.90,Default,,0,0,0,,and you know, one of the guide rules for flight is that you don't use "new" after you take off.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.90,0:11:41.04,Default,,0,0,0,,and you never use "delete"
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.30,0:11:45.94,Default,,0,0,0,,maybe these are not the most appropriate guidelines elsewhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.19,0:11:51.40,Default,,0,0,0,,other guidelines have similar kind of bias and constraint, and people tend to forget them.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.78,0:11:55.37,Default,,0,0,0,,and a lot of them are very long winded.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.37,0:11:59.73,Default,,0,0,0,,you really need to be a language lawyer to understand them.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:59.73,0:12:04.41,Default,,0,0,0,,I looked at the rules for how to use pointers in c++
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.41,0:12:10.36,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, I was miserable, I couldn't understand all those rules.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:10.66,0:12:13.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and you can't follow them, really.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:13.00,0:12:18.81,Default,,0,0,0,,and a lot of guidelines don't have very good tools
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.15,0:12:21.38,Default,,0,0,0,,and they have platform dependencies

Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.77,0:12:24.50,Default,,0,0,0,,and the don't produce guidance.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:24.70,0:12:33.68,Default,,0,0,0,,I really like to emphasize that telling people what not to do is less helpfull than telling what to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:33.79,0:12:36.30,Default,,0,0,0,,so let's do those good guidelines
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.30,0:12:40.49,Default,,0,0,0,,comprehensive, browserable, for modern c++, for the moment
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.49,0:12:53.04,Default,,0,0,0,,first of all, let's ignore legacy code, let's ignore old stuff. let's write the rules for what we would like our code to look like in 5 to 10 years
Dialogue: 0,0:12:53.20,0:12:59.06,Default,,0,0,0,,and then we'll deal with how to do the transition, how to do with  in compatibility when we have to.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.36,0:13:03.16,Default,,0,0,0,,gradual adaption is essential.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.41,0:13:05.26,Default,,0,0,0,,prescriptive teachable
Dialogue: 0,0:13:05.29,0:13:11.46,Default,,0,0,0,,one of the things that hold c++ back is that there are really a lot of bad teaching materials out there.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.46,0:13:14.22,Default,,0,0,0,,some of it is very old, some of it is backwards-looking
Dialogue: 0,0:13:14.29,0:13:19.57,Default,,0,0,0,,some of it try to maximize the pill by domain it down
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.57,0:13:21.03,Default,,0,0,0,,and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:21.18,0:13:26.34,Default,,0,0,0,,so a setup guidelines can also guide teachers to how to teaching.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:26.54,0:13:29.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Flexiable of course. Because the huge community.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:29.64,0:13:30.08,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean
Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.19,0:13:33.98,Default,,0,0,0,,we recover just about everything that's been done on computing
Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.12,0:13:36.07,Default,,0,0,0,,And of course Non-proprietary.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.07,0:13:39.68,Default,,0,0,0,,We couldn't possibly do this with limits.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.28,0:13:46.51,Default,,0,0,0,,There are some high level rules and there are some low-level rules.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:46.59,0:13:50.57,Default,,0,0,0,,the high-level rules are there to provide a conceptual framework for everything
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.68,0:13:53.48,Default,,0,0,0,,that sort of philosophical on nature.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:53.60,0:13:54.79,Default,,0,0,0,,and they are very useful.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:54.79,0:14:00.43,Default,,0,0,0,,like, you have to expre4ss ideas in code - compilers don't read the comments.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:00.52,0:14:08.12,Default,,0,0,0,,and you use ISO standard c++, yes there are reasons to use extensions as such
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.12,0:14:13.54,Default,,0,0,0,,but we are not going to deal with that, that will be for paticular restrictions
Dialogue: 0,0:14:13.72,0:14:16.36,Default,,0,0,0,,And we want static type safety
Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.10,0:14:18.14,Default,,0,0,0,,etc.etc
Dialogue: 0,0:14:18.32,0:14:21.17,Default,,0,0,0,,so there a philosophical framework here 
Dialogue: 0,0:14:21.31,0:14:26.70,Default,,0,0,0,,the problem is that again compilers and programmers don't really get philosophy.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.90,0:14:35.84,Default,,0,0,0,, it means that you have to transfer into something that can be understood in detail in context of a piece of program and use.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:35.84,0:14:38.54,Default,,0,0,0,,so for that reason there is a whole bunch of low-level rules.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:38.79,0:14:43.65,Default,,0,0,0,,that basically you guys should threw the massive alternatives and features
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.26,0:14:52.70,Default,,0,0,0,,the low-level rules, things like, use T* to designate a single object, not array.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.90,0:14:57.58,Default,,0,0,0,,and prefer initialization to assignment in constructors
Dialogue: 0,0:14:57.71,0:15:01.08,Default,,0,0,0,,these are easily checkable.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.08,0:15:04.18,Default,,0,0,0,,we have a tool that tells you when you violate it.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:04.24,0:15:06.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Always initialize an object
Dialogue: 0,0:15:06.04,0:15:11.96,Default,,0,0,0,,compilers these days do. but it's a good rule and we can do even better with external tools that we have them.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:12.01,0:15:15.29,Default,,0,0,0,,so basically that sort of shows the way through the world dominance
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.66,0:15:22.27,Default,,0,0,0,,and the tools provide feedback for programers, it also helps unify styles.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.58,0:15:27.34,Default,,0,0,0,,if I look at a piece of code and I see a string,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:27.34,0:15:30.20,Default,,0,0,0,,if I know it's std::string, I know a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:30.37,0:15:34.28,Default,,0,0,0,,and it helped me, and I don't have to go back and read the manual again.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:35.51,0:15:47.51,Default,,0,0,0,,so a more unify style helps getting code written quickly, helps me read the code, understand the code
Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.70,0:15:53.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and one thing you should understand is that the rules and not mean to be minimal or orthogonal.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:54.23,0:16:01.74,Default,,0,0,0,,text book writters spend a lot of time trying to make sure that fix minimal amount of paper.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:02.54,0:16:03.79,Default,,0,0,0,,this is not we are up to
Dialogue: 0,0:16:04.06,0:16:12.33,Default,,0,0,0,,we try to have the most helpful, and have a large set tool to tell you when you fall over the edge.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:12.88,0:16:16.58,Default,,0,0,0,,so the structure of a rule is simple and structured.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:18.24,0:16:21.46,Default,,0,0,0,,"No naked new" for instance, it's a rule.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:21.46,0:16:24.65,Default,,0,0,0,,and Reference numbers - people love reference numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:16:24.65,0:16:27.15,Default,,0,0,0,,It also means that you can search for them.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:27.26,0:16:31.62,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean you can refer to them in error messages. things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:32.01,0:16:38.49,Default,,0,0,0,,and NEVER NEVER tell people what not to do without giving a reason or what to do without giving a reason
Dialogue: 0,0:16:38.53,0:16:44.15,Default,,0,0,0,,so every rule with the first thing that comes up with the rule itself is that rational a reason.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:44.50,0:16:46.32,Default,,0,0,0,,and then it comes with an example.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:46.40,0:16:53.05,Default,,0,0,0,,because by and large we don't understand abstract text, we need a concrete example or more
Dialogue: 0,0:16:53.38,0:16:57.70,Default,,0,0,0,,if it's a "don't do this" rule, there should be alternatives.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:57.81,0:17:01.12,Default,,0,0,0,,never tell people what not to do unless you give them alternatives.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:01.84,0:17:03.54,Default,,0,0,0,,fairly simple to say.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:03.79,0:17:05.64,Default,,0,0,0,,little bit hard to do sometimes.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:05.70,0:17:10.83,Default,,0,0,0,,these rules are variable and value for a long time.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.23,0:17:13.55,Default,,0,0,0,,There's references to other things.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:13.55,0:17:18.34,Default,,0,0,0,,There's notes, things that we just felt was useful to say
Dialogue: 0,0:17:18.44,0:17:26.99,Default,,0,0,0,,and then, there suppose to be long discussion at the end where you discuss a set of rules, set of reasons as such.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:27.12,0:17:28.84,Default,,0,0,0,,it's bit weak just now.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:28.91,0:17:30.62,Default,,0,0,0,,but that's the idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:30.73,0:17:40.05,Default,,0,0,0,,some time you need more. as an explanation,  that what fits on above this many lines, fit right on your screen when you look at them.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:40.30,0:17:42.53,Default,,0,0,0,,so that's structure.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:42.87,0:17:52.28,Default,,0,0,0,,the general idea is that people who have tryed to subset language have by and large failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:52.81,0:18:02.73,Default,,0,0,0,,the thing that you really want to get rid of, like bad uses of pointers, bad interactions between inheritance and arrays and things like that
Dialogue: 0,0:18:02.73,0:18:08.96,Default,,0,0,0,,if you just ban everything to get rid of problems, you can't write decent code anymore
Dialogue: 0,0:18:08.96,0:18:11.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes! I want to write high-level code!
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.95,0:18:19.79,Default,,0,0,0,,But how do I do that? I do that by having libraries that allow me to write high-level code, and they implemented it using low-level code.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:19.79,0:18:24.22,Default,,0,0,0,,because otherwise you can't get the efficiency and portability out of that.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:24.22,0:18:27.55,Default,,0,0,0,,So, the general idea is not just the subset.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:27.55,0:18:30.20,Default,,0,0,0,,First, we provide a superset.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:30.20,0:18:33.52,Default,,0,0,0,,we have ISO standard C++
Dialogue: 0,0:18:33.60,0:18:38.99,Default,,0,0,0,,we have parts of the standard library that we recommend and that's you can use when you want to.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:39.18,0:18:52.81,Default,,0,0,0,,and we have something called the guidelines port libraries which is small set - small as less than 2 dozen little classes and really that smaill - that's added.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:53.04,0:18:54.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And that way, we can say:
Dialogue: 0,0:18:54.76,0:18:57.52,Default,,0,0,0,,the messy dangerous bits, don't use them.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:57.71,0:19:08.54,Default,,0,0,0,,we have provided abstractions that are elegent and efficient to allow you to not go there most of the time, for most people, all of the time.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:08.54,0:19:13.36,Default,,0,0,0,,once you build that superset - the language + libraries.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:13.52,0:19:17.04,Default,,0,0,0,,the you subset, and you can get rid of a lot of the crack.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:17.18,0:19:24.43,Default,,0,0,0,,this is not a brand new idea I wrote a paper about it sometime more than ten years ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:24.60,0:19:32.12,Default,,0,0,0,,so, really what we want is not neutered subset of c++ which is a lot of people that tryed.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:32.12,0:19:35.16,Default,,0,0,0,,we want c++ on steroids on the other hand.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:35.16,0:19:36.97,Default,,0,0,0,,so more of a good stuff.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:37.21,0:19:40.78,Default,,0,0,0,,so the rules rely on the libraries.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:40.88,0:19:43.52,Default,,0,0,0,,you can use any standard libraries of course.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:43.69,0:19:46.91,Default,,0,0,0,,but once we rely on it, things like
Dialogue: 0,0:19:46.91,0:19:50.84,Default,,0,0,0,,standart library class like vector or unique_ptr
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.84,0:19:59.13,Default,,0,0,0,,and some guideline things array_view -  this is when you have a begining of a sequence and end
Dialogue: 0,0:20:01.08,0:20:05.42,Default,,0,0,0,,not_null - you can say that a pointer shouldn't be null
Dialogue: 0,0:20:05.42,0:20:06.36,Default,,0,0,0,,now get back to that
Dialogue: 0,0:20:06.51,0:20:10.57,Default,,0,0,0,,so there's rules for using the GSL
