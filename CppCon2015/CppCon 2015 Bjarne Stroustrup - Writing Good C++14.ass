Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:02.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, Now we can go
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.41,0:00:10.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Welcome~\n\nIt's very nice and a little bit scary to see you all again
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.75,0:00:19.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And especially happy to see a lot of old friends and also a lot of people that are new here
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.19,0:00:27.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Anyway, I'm going to talk about how to write code
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.23,0:00:39.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and in particular \n-- a question has been boggle for a while, and I know it has boggle for a lot of new people -- is \n "What is good modern C++" ?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.45,0:00:46.18,Default,,0,0,0,,We've done lots to the the languages over the last five years
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.37,0:00:52.47,Default,,0,0,0,,And lot of people have ideas about what it is to write good c++
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.74,0:00:55.74,Default,,0,0,0,,and , lots of people ask about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.74,0:01:04.02,Default,,0,0,0,,so, this spring, I started a project trying to make some guidelines to how to write this
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.05,0:01:09.46,Default,,0,0,0,,turned out that other people were on the same kind of idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.61,0:01:13.79,Default,,0,0,0,,so some of us try to provide some useful answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.04,0:01:22.28,Default,,0,0,0,,and one of the things that is important here, is that we would like to help many people
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.61,0:01:27.32,Default,,0,0,0,,thers is more that 4million c++ programers.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.57,0:01:34.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and if we come up with a solution that can (only) be handled by 200 language experts, we failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.47,0:01:42.20,Default,,0,0,0,,so , this is an attempt to be able to help a lot of people.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.57,0:01:46.56,Default,,0,0,0,,and a lot of we've seen it, we have a great language now.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.65,0:01:52.74,Default,,0,0,0,,it's a modern language, it can do really nice things that we couldn't do 10-20 years ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.79,0:01:59.63,Default,,0,0,0,,c++11 is good. c++14 is better. both are in wide-spread production use.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.63,0:02:02.09,Default,,0,0,0,,These are not toy languages.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.24,0:02:08.61,Default,,0,0,0,,And from I see in the standards commitee, c++17 is even better.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.85,0:02:22.51,Default,,0,0,0,,There is technical specifications like filesystem and concepts and such that are rolling out. Things are happening.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.51,0:02:44.95,Default,,0,0,0,,So, I know from experience, from wide experience from industrial experience, that c++1* is easier to write, easier to maintain, runs faster and can express more that older c++ styles with less code
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.54,0:02:47.11,Default,,0,0,0,,This is a fact
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.52,0:02:51.40,Default,,0,0,0,,It's also a fact that very few people do it!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.67,0:02:57.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe you know a thousand people that write such modern code.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.74,0:03:02.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe you know 10 thousand people, but that's only very tiny small fraction of the community.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.86,0:03:04.35,Default,,0,0,0,,We have to do something better.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.35,0:03:10.78,Default,,0,0,0,,People are writting c++ in really archaic and foreign styles
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.23,0:03:16.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Also you going to web and you'll see every little so-and-so trying to be language expert.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.20,0:03:20.40,Default,,0,0,0,,And discussing the sanitates of rvalue references.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.40,0:03:27.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Which does actually matter in most code unless you are writting a high performence library for use of others.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.65,0:03:34.68,Default,,0,0,0,,So, they are all trying to be language lawyers and getting lost in technical details.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.11,0:03:43.55,Default,,0,0,0,,so basicly idea is "Doctor, docker, it hurts when I hit myself on the head with a hammer". The obvious answer is "so don't do it!"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.81,0:03:45.81,Default,,0,0,0,,And that's what we are trying to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.93,0:03:49.05,Default,,0,0,0,,There is a quote by me --
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.45,0:03:56.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Within c++ language there is a smaller simplier safer language struggling to get out.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.77,0:04:02.50,Default,,0,0,0,,I think I said that in 94, 92... It a long time ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.75,0:04:05.78,Default,,0,0,0,,it is even more true today that was there.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.93,0:04:12.63,Default,,0,0,0,,You can simplify the code\n you can maintain the efficiency\nand we don't limit what you can say.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.63,0:04:14.24,Default,,0,0,0,,these are important things.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.24,0:04:16.24,Default,,0,0,0,,This is C++!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.24,0:04:21.11,Default,,0,0,0,,It's not a so specialize language for a paticular application.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.73,0:04:25.34,Default,,0,0,0,,So, lets get it out! lets get it out now!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.57,0:04:30.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Lot of people solution to getting things better and simpler it to invent new languages.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.84,0:04:32.84,Default,,0,0,0,,but that not now.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.84,0:04:42.18,Default,,0,0,0,,If you invent a really good new language now,  large number of people will be able to use it, in 10 years, if you succeed.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.36,0:04:48.97,Default,,0,0,0,,The succee rate for new languages especially general purpose programming languages is very close to zero.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.97,0:04:50.97,Default,,0,0,0,,so, lets do it now!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.20,0:04:53.91,Default,,0,0,0,,And I want to use those compilers.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.91,0:04:59.92,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, have you seen what compilers can do with your code interms of optimizing it?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.92,0:05:08.69,Default,,0,0,0,,doesn't matter which compiler you are using for a modern compiler and sort of standard hardware. it's amazing.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.90,0:05:15.69,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, I am not sure what I could have done it if I had 10 years. but they did. this is going on for a long time.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.69,0:05:23.70,Default,,0,0,0,,this doesn't just happen for a new language unless you can hijack the c++ code generation phase. which is a fair gain.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.94,0:05:32.82,Default,,0,0,0,,So, I'm going to look for coding guidelines, provide guidence to people who wants to write modern c++ what ever that means.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.01,0:05:40.04,Default,,0,0,0,,And, I know that just telling people what to do doesn't quite work.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.04,0:05:43.04,Default,,0,0,0,,so you need support by tools and libraries.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.18,0:05:50.25,Default,,0,0,0,,and again, we want generality, we want performence, we want simple code, and we want portibility.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.25,0:05:54.77,Default,,0,0,0,,I dont want to be tight down by paticular hardware, paticular operation system.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.05,0:05:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,those all the gameness.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.52,0:06:02.78,Default,,0,0,0,,I think we can do it. And I think we can do it, I know that I can't do it alone.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.78,0:06:06.50,Default,,0,0,0,,I know that well that might be a genius somewhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.50,0:06:08.99,Default,,0,0,0,,But I think I know that no individual can do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.14,0:06:11.97,Default,,0,0,0,,And, no single company can
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.11,0:06:17.39,Default,,0,0,0,,It will be cature
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.39,0:06:19.15,Default,,0,0,0,,and you couldn't trust it all time.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.15,0:06:27.14,Default,,0,0,0,,people explained that to me a long time ago to ensure that I took part in the (c++) standardization, so please help.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.14,0:06:33.16,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm going to say a little bit about what help we would like and who we are and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.16,0:06:36.05,Default,,0,0,0,,so the initial work started
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.05,0:06:39.39,Default,,0,0,0,,there was a project out of microsoft by Herb Sutter and friends
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.39,0:06:42.01,Default,,0,0,0,,I started something at Morgan Stanley
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.01,0:06:45.98,Default,,0,0,0,,CERN has joined and contributed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.98,0:06:47.98,Default,,0,0,0,,And things are available.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.98,0:06:49.98,Default,,0,0,0,,its there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.98,0:06:55.06,Default,,0,0,0,,you can find it on github, give you the urls towards the end.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.06,0:06:58.29,Default,,0,0,0,,there is guide lines. a lot of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.49,0:07:00.64,Default,,0,0,0,,there is little support library.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.64,0:07:11.48,Default,,0,0,0,,which is some very simple classes that mostly mapping into standard library stuff if not  map straghtly into portable c++.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.48,0:07:16.44,Default,,0,0,0,,portable meaning microsoft, gcc, clang; Windows, Linux, Mac
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.53,0:07:17.64,Default,,0,0,0,,and mac yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.97,0:07:25.52,Default,,0,0,0,,there is analyze tool that will be ship by the guy at microsoft that wrote it next month
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.53,0:07:38.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and we hope to have port available later. maybe November? I don't know. I mean, you know, software project some time suffer delays.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.42,0:07:41.09,Default,,0,0,0,,but we are planning for it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.13,0:07:46.58,Default,,0,0,0,,it exists. so I am saying anything in this talk that are science fictions.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.93,0:07:50.52,Default,,0,0,0,,and its MIT licensed, so its open and free.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.52,0:07:51.44,Default,,0,0,0,,so you can get it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.88,0:07:54.10,Default,,0,0,0,,and there's more talk about this.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.02,0:08:01.92,Default,,0,0,0,,I am going to explain what we are trying to do with higher level terms with some examples
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.17,0:08:04.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Herb Sutter is going to talk more about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.23,0:08:13.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Gabriel Dos Reis are going to talk how, er, ties into some of the work been done in the standard commitee for writting better code.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.32,0:08:21.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Neil Macintosh who wrote the tool that we work with, are going to talk about static analysis and some of the classes.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.95,0:08:23.12,Default,,0,0,0,,This is all this weak.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.83,0:08:29.08,Default,,0,0,0,,This is a problem with coding rules, with guide lines.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.33,0:08:30.44,Default,,0,0,0,,which is...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.45,0:08:32.65,Default,,0,0,0,,have you even seen one you really liked?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.92,0:08:37.18,Default,,0,0,0,,that might be necessary. but it's like medicine, doesn't taste good.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.77,0:08:39.63,Default,,0,0,0,,we all hate coding rules.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.79,0:08:44.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Usual caveats and thanks to the people who was made the less usual and paticular cases.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.92,0:08:46.31,Default,,0,0,0,,but basicly we don't like it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.60,0:08:48.76,Default,,0,0,0,,and one of the reasons is that
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.97,0:08:53.48,Default,,0,0,0,,coding guidelines tend to be written to prevent accident
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.77,0:08:59.96,Default,,0,0,0,,so to keep novices that are not as smart as us from doing stupid things
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.01,0:09:02.87,Default,,0,0,0,,so it's long lists of don't do this and don't do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.96,0:09:03.49,Default,,0,0,0,,and
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.68,0:09:07.03,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't like such lists and I know most of you don't like neither.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.18,0:09:12.34,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's very often written at the start of an organization
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.40,0:09:18.41,Default,,0,0,0,,when people is little bit uncertain about what they want to do and they want to avoid problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.41,0:09:21.54,Default,,0,0,0,,and rules tend to focus on low-level things
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.54,0:09:22.99,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, eh
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.07,0:09:25.20,Default,,0,0,0,,do use camel case underscores
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.20,0:09:27.90,Default,,0,0,0,,how many yea spaces to use to indent
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.24,0:09:32.08,Default,,0,0,0,,these are all very interesting, could be in the essential for our organization 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.15,0:09:37.34,Default,,0,0,0,,but it has nothing much to do with how you get quality software at the higher level.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.41,0:09:41.36,Default,,0,0,0,,how do you actually recognize a good piece of code when you came to see it?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.76,0:09:46.23,Default,,0,0,0,,a lot of them simply sets restrictions.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.44,0:09:55.96,Default,,0,0,0,,don't use overloading; don't use exceptions; don't use multiple-inheritance; don't use casts.... all kinds of rules like that
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.11,0:10:04.36,Default,,0,0,0,,some are good. some are bad. some are good in some paticular environment. some are not.\nAnd really, there is lot of bad advice out there.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.61,0:10:09.77,Default,,0,0,0,,there are guidelines that tell you that you really should trying write java.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.77,0:10:11.77,Default,,0,0,0,,d
