Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:02.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, Now we can go
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.41,0:00:10.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Welcome~\n\nIt's very nice and a little bit scary to see you all again
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.75,0:00:19.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And especially happy to see a lot of old friends and also a lot of people that are new here
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.19,0:00:27.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Anyway, I'm going to talk about how to write code
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.23,0:00:39.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and in particular \n-- a question has been boggle for a while, and I know it has boggle for a lot of new people -- is \n "What is good modern C++" ?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.45,0:00:46.18,Default,,0,0,0,,We've done lots to the the languages over the last five years
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.37,0:00:52.47,Default,,0,0,0,,And lot of people have ideas about what it is to write good c++
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.74,0:00:55.74,Default,,0,0,0,,and , lots of people ask about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.74,0:01:04.02,Default,,0,0,0,,so, this spring, I started a project trying to make some guidelines to how to write this
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.05,0:01:09.46,Default,,0,0,0,,turned out that other people were on the same kind of idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.61,0:01:13.79,Default,,0,0,0,,so some of us try to provide some useful answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.04,0:01:22.28,Default,,0,0,0,,and one of the things that is important here, is that we would like to help many people
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.61,0:01:27.32,Default,,0,0,0,,thers is more that 4million c++ programers.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.57,0:01:34.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and if we come up with a solution that can (only) be handled by 200 language experts, we failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.47,0:01:42.20,Default,,0,0,0,,so , this is an attempt to be able to help a lot people.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.57,0:01:46.56,Default,,0,0,0,,and a lot of we've seen it, we have s great language now.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.65,0:01:52.74,Default,,0,0,0,,it's a modern language, it can do really nice things that we couldn't do 10-20 years ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.79,0:01:59.63,Default,,0,0,0,,c++11 is good. c++14 is better. both are in wide-spread production use.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.63,0:02:02.09,Default,,0,0,0,,These are not toy languages.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.24,0:02:08.61,Default,,0,0,0,,And from I see in the standards commitee, c++17 is even better.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.85,0:02:22.51,Default,,0,0,0,,There is technical specifications like filesystem and concepts as such that are rolling out. Things are happening.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.51,0:02:44.95,Default,,0,0,0,,So, I know from experience, from wide experience from industrial experience, that c++1* is easier to write, easier to maintain, runs faster and can express more that older c++ styles with less code
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.54,0:02:47.11,Default,,0,0,0,,This is a fact
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.52,0:02:51.40,Default,,0,0,0,,It's also a fact that very few people do it!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.67,0:02:57.47,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe you know a thousand people that write such modern code.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.74,0:03:02.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe you know 10 thousand people, but that's only very tiny small fraction of the community.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.86,0:03:04.35,Default,,0,0,0,,We have to do something better.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.35,0:03:10.78,Default,,0,0,0,,People are writting c++ in really archaic and foreign styles
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.28,0:03:20.40,Default,,0,0,0,,
